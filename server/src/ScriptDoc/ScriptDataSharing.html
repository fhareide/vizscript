<h2>Viz 3 Script - Data Sharing</h2>



<p>This
document describes the data sharing mechanism provided by shared memory maps (SSM). An SSM
is a map holding user-defined variables indexed by a string. It is exposed to the script interface via&nbsp; the <a href="DataTypeSharedMemory.html">SharedMemory</a> data type. The variables are
stored as <a href="DataTypeVariant.html">Variant</a> objects and thus can hold objects of any other
type. Any script has access to three SSMs:</p>




<ul>



 <li><tt><a href="DataTypeScene.html">Scene</a>.Map</tt>: This is the map local to the
     current scene. Every scene has one map that can be used to exchange data
     among the scripts in the scene.</li>



 <li><tt><a href="DataTypeSystem.html">System</a>.Map</tt>:
     The system-wide map. It allows for data sharing among the scenes currently
     loaded into memory.</li>



 <li><tt><a href="DataTypeVizCommunication.html">VizCommunication</a>.Map</tt>:
     A distributed map that enables data sharing among the computers connected
     to one viz database.</li>



</ul>





<p>Here is an
example that shows how a scene map can be used to pass data from one
script to
another (within the same scene). The first script defines the
OnEnterSubContainer, which is called whenever the mouse-cursor enters
any of its
sub-containers. In it, the name of the subcontainer
is stored in the scene map under the key&nbsp;subcontainer_name.</p>




<pre class="code">
' Script 1:
Sub OnEnterSubContainer(subContainer As Container)
    Scene.Map["subcontainer_name"] = subContainer.Name
End Sub
</pre>




<p>In a second
script, we retrieve the previously stored value, cast it to a string, and
output it as text (we assume that the container
holding the script has a text geometry). </p>




<pre class="code">
' Script 2:
Sub OnExecPerField()
    Geometry.Text = (String)System.Map["subcontainer_name"]
End Sub
</pre>




<h3>Reveiving Notification on Map Changes</h3>




<p>Sometimes
you want to be notified when a value in a SSM changes, so you don't have to
poll for&nbsp;changes within <tt>OnExecPerField</tt>. This is done by calling a map's <tt>RegisterChangedCallback</tt> procedure,
passing it the name of a key that you want to monitor. Now,
whenever the variable identified by that key is changed, the <tt>OnSharedMemoryVariableChanged</tt> callback (if
present) is invoked. Similarly, the <tt>OnSharedMemoryVariableDeleted</tt> callback
is invoked, when the variable is deleted.

</p>



<h4>Example:</h4>




<pre class="code">
Sub OnInit()
    Scene.Map.RegisterChangedCallback("subcontainer_name")
End Sub

Sub OnSharedMemoryVariableChanged(map As SharedMemory, mapKey As String)
    If mapKey = "subcontainer_name" Then
        Geometry.Text = (String)map["subcontainer_name"]
    End If
End Sub
</pre>




<p>Note that <tt>OnSharedMemoryVariableChanged</tt> is passed the map as well as the
key whose variable&nbsp;has been changed.</p>




<p>If you pass an empty string ("") to <tt>RegisterChangedCallback</tt>, <tt>OnSharedMemoryVariableChanged</tt> and <tt>OnSharedMemoryVariableDeleted</tt> will be invoked whenever any variable in the map is modified or
deleted:</p>








<pre class="code">
Sub OnInit()
    Scene.Map.RegisterChangedCallback("")
End Sub

Sub OnSharedMemoryVariableChanged(map As SharedMemory, mapKey As String)
    ...
End Sub
</pre>


<h3>VizCommunication.Map</h3>


<p>The map exposed by the <a href="DataTypeVizCommunication.html">VizCommunication</a> type is used to
share data among the client computers connected to a viz
database. Whenever a script on one client adds a new value or changes an
existing value in the map, the change is propagated&nbsp;to the other clients
via database messaging to update the local copy of each client's map. Note,
however, that this does not necessarily mean that all local client maps are
identical. When a client starts up after other clients have made changes
to the <tt>VizCommunication.Map</tt>, it is not
informed of those changes. To work around this limitation, one client can save
the entire contents of the map by calling the map's <tt>SaveToDb</tt> procedure, and
another client can read it by calling <tt>LoadFromDb</tt>.</p>
<h3>Accessing Maps via the UDP interface</h3>
Elements in the
distributed memory map (VizCommunication.Map) can be set (but not
retrieved) via a UDP interface exposed by viz. This option is
particularly useful when writing external control applications. A C++
library, the VizControlLib, is provided to encapsulate all required
communication and serialization logic. The VizControlLib can be found
in &lt;viz3 install directory&gt;/Tools/ControlLib. Please refer to the
header files and the included test project for more information.

<h3>Accessing Maps through the command interface</h3>
<p>There is limited support for getting and setting map elements via
the command interface. The maps are accessible through these locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;scene&gt;*MAP for the scene specific map</li>
  <li>GLOBAL*MAP for system-wide map</li>
  <li>VIZ_COMMUNICATION*MAP for the distributed map</li>
</ul>
Here is a list of commands supported by each of these maps:<br />
<ul>
  <li>SET_BOOLEAN_ELEMENT and&nbsp;GET_BOOLEAN_ELEMENT</li>
  <li>SET_INTEGER_ELEMENT and GET_INTEGER_ELEMENT</li>
  <li>SET_DOUBLE_ELEMENT and GET_DOUBLE_ELEMENT</li>
  <li>SET_STRING_ELEMENT and GET_STRING_ELEMENT</li>
</ul>
Examples:<br />
<ul>
  <li>VIZ_COMMUNICATION*MAP&nbsp;SET_DOUBLE_ELEMENT "my_double" 1.2</li>
  <li>VIZ_COMMUNICATION*MAP GET_DOUBLE_ELEMENT "my_double"<br />
=&gt; Answer = "1.2"<br />
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Maps from within Plugins</h3>
Functions for getting and setting map elments are provided by the
plugin interface. For more information, refer to the
evPlugin_SHARED_MEMORY.h file, which is part of the plugin SDK
(&lt;viz3 install directory&gt;/Plugin/src).
